# User Creator Script
## _for Ombi Request Tool_

UCS is a free script which automatically
generates user accounts for users without a Plex Account in Ombi.

You need the email addresses of the users to be created
stored in a Google Spreadsheet.
This process can also be automated using Google Forms. But this is optional.

A small tutorial will follow soon!
